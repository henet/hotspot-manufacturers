### Application to become an approved third party Distributor 

# Summary 
Fastminers is an exclusive distributor, reseller and also an after sale service provider for mining devices (e.g. HNT hotspots, Deeper Network mini, ASIC miners, etc…). With the rapid development of societies, the demand to electronic devices has been growing exponentially around the globe. The chipsets shortage we have witnessed lately due to covid19, together with the huge demand to crypto mining devices have made very difficult and almost impossible in some cases for people around the world to put their hand on such devices; as a consequence, black market has widely developed in this field where some resellers abuse of desperate consumers with extremely inflated prices. In this context, we have founded Fastminers to fight this black market price inflation and give people the opportunity to buy mining devices at fair prices and without an extremely long waiting queue. Fastminers serves as a bridge between manufacturers and consumers. We work closely with several manufacturers to guarantee high quality devices and delivery within short period of time. Through our warehouses located in US and Eu, we make sure customers receive their devices in best conditions, fast and at reasonable prices. 

* We are currently partnered with several companies including Cotx Networks for COTX Eu HNT miners distribution; we provide the cheapest prices for customers on the market compared to other resellers of these COTX miners. We are also an exclusive distributor for Deeper Network mini (DPR token mining device) in North America. We are currently in talks with many other manufacturers to expand our coverage to new mining devices.
